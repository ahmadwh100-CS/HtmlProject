<h1 align="center"> About Us</h1>
<p align=Justify style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; margin: 15px; text-indent: 30px;"> Pizza Heaven is all about quality you can trust. Our main mission is making the freshest, tastiest and cheesiest Pizza around.

Our classic pan pizza will always be a fan favourite, with a soft and chewy crust perfectly balancing out the healthy tomato pure and mozzarella - cheddar blended cheese.

Our authentic Italian crust for those who would prefer a light and airy crust to more fully enjoy the toppings. Thin, light and delicious.
</p>
<p align=Justify style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; margin: 15px; text-indent: 30px;">
Our newest addition of Puree sauces will blow your mind. Chose between a spicy buffalo, sweet BBQ, tangy chipotle can creamy makhni to perfectly compliment your toppings and crust. Our suggestions of combinations might be helpful but ultimately the power lies with you.

Contrary to industry standard strategy, Pizza Heaven, since 2010, has been committed to growing our brand slowly and steadily. 

Everywhere we go, we hear ‘Your pizza is the tastiest pizza around, why aren’t you open in my location’. The answer is simple, every outlet opened is a promise to our customer, and not one we take lightly.
